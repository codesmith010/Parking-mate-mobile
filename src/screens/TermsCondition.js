            “our”) with respect to our collection, use, storage and disclosure
            of personal information provided to us from users of our Website.
            This Policy forms an integral part of Terms of Use Agreement, which
            is incorporated by reference. Any capitalized term used but not

            {"\n"} We respect and uphold individual rights to privacy and the
            protection of personal information. We know how important it is to
            protect Your personal information and want to make every customer
            experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have
            developed this Policy to explain our practices for the collection,
            use, and disclosure of Your personal information.{"\n"}   For the
            purposes of this Policy, “personal information” means information
            about an identifiable individual, including, for example, an
            individual’s height, birth date, name, home address, telephone
            number, social insurance number, sex, income and marital status. We
            will only collect, use or disclose personal information in
            accordance with this Policy, or in accordance with laws applicable
            to the collection, use and disclosure of Your personal information
            by us (“Applicable Privacy Laws”).{"\n"}   We have appointed a
            Privacy Officer who is responsible for our compliance with this
            Policy. Information on how to contact the Privacy Officer can be
            found below.{"\n"}  {"\n"}

              COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
            </Text>{" "}
            {"\n"} We collect two types of information through our App: personal
            information and non-personal information. The types of information
            we collect depend on the nature of Your interaction with us.
            Personal information We may collect personal informationsuch as:  
            Your contact information – for example, Your name and email address;
            Your personal preferences – for example, language preferences, and
            marketing consent; and Your profile information – for example,
            photographs You upload, and other information You provide in Your
            personal profile, such as Your interests, marital status, Your
            height, weight and occupation. Non-personal information Non-personal
            information does not identify You as an individual.{"\n"}For
            example:   we may collect certain non-personal data when You visit
            our Website, such as the type of browser You are using or the
            referring URL; or we may collect and summarize customer information
            in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research
            purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that
            a certain percentage of users are male, aged 18 to 25.{"\n"}You may
            choose not to provide us with Your personal information. However, if
            You make this choice we may not be able to provide You with the
            service, or information that You requested. For example, we require
            Your email address in order to verify Your account, which is
            necessary so that notifications may be sent to You electronically.
            {"\n"} Should You no longer wish to receive notifications from THE
            FIT-HUBS APP when You receive a message from another THE FIT-HUBS
            APP user or when another user adds You as a favorite, THE FIT-HUBS
            APP will not send You notifications after Your account is deleted.

            {"\n"}
            <Text style={styles.myHeading}>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</Text>
            {"\n"} We may use Your personal information for a number of
            different business purposes, for example to:   create and display
            Your online Yoga/’Well Being’ establishment profile to other users
            of the Website/App; show other users when You have viewed their
            profiles; compare Your profile and preferences with that of other
            users to provide both You and other users with Yoga services
            matches; provide customer support to assist You with Your questions
            or complaints; conduct surveys in order to improve our services;
            advise You of changes to our services, or new services that we may
            implement from time to time; measure and improve the effectiveness
            of our Website or our marketing endeavor’s; detect and protect
            against fraud and error; track and analyze Your preferences to
            better understand Your service needs and eligibility; and for other
            purposes as described in this Policy.{"\n"}We limit the personal
            information we collect and use to that which is necessary to fulfill
            our business purposes. We will not collect, sell, distribute or use
            personal information for any other purposes without Your further
            consent, except to the extent as required by law or as authorized by
            Applicable Privacy Laws.{"\n"}  {"\n"}
            <Text style={styles.myHeading}> YOUR CONSENT</Text>
            {"\n"} When You choose to provide us with Your personal information
            You consent to the use of Your personal information as identified in
            this Policy and as may be further identified at the time of
            collection.{"\n"}Express Consent Sometimes You will be asked to give
            Your express consent to our collection, use or disclosure of
            personal information – for example, by being asked to check a box to
            indicate Your consent to receive marketing communications.{"\n"}
            Implied Consent Other times, You may provide Your implied consent to
            our collection, use or disclosure of personal information when we
            can reasonably conclude that You have given consent by some action
            You have taken or an action You have decided not to take. Generally,
            this occurs where the purpose for the use of Your personal
            information would be reasonably apparent to You – for example, when
            You provide us with personal information through forms to populate
            Your online dating profile, You provide us with implied consent to
            publish that information for other users of the Website to view.

            You wish to withdraw or change Your consent to our use and
            disclosure of Your information. We will accommodate Your request

            users (“Campaigns”) to generate revenue. We never share Your
            personal information with our advertisers for their Campaigns.
            However, we will use elements of Your personal information to create
            a list of users that advertisers may want to direct their Campaigns
            to. Advertisers may decide to serve advertisements to all of our
            users (“General Campaigns”), or to send messages to specific
            segments of our user base (“Direct Campaigns”) based on particular
            personal characteristics (for example, age, sex or geographic
            location). In the case of Direct Campaigns, we may use different
            elements of Your personal preferences to develop and display
            advertising content tailored to Your preferences.{"\n"}Matching From
            time to time we will use some elements of Your personal information

            We may disclose Your information as permitted or required by law.
            For example, we may be compelled to release information by a court
            of law or other person or entity with jurisdiction to compel
            production of such information. If we have reasonable grounds to
            believe information could be useful in the investigation of improper
            or unlawful activity, we may disclose information to law enforcement
            agencies or other appropriate investigative bodies.   {"\n"}

              SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
            </Text>
            {"\n"} The security of Your personal information is a high priority
            for us. We maintain appropriate safeguards and current security
            standards to protect Your personal information, whether recorded on
            paper or captured electronically, against unauthorized access,
            disclosure, or misuse. For example, electronic records are stored in
            secure, limited-access servers; we employ technological tools like
            firewalls and passwords; and we ensure our employees are trained on
            the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of
            personal information.{"\n"} Reasonably secure methods are used
            whenever we destroy personal information. For example, we currently
            use SSL encryption with a 2048 bit RSA key digital certificate.
            However, no system can be completely secure. While THE FIT-HUBS APP
            takes steps to secure Your information, we do not promise, and You
            should not expect, that Your personal information will always remain
            secure.{"\n"}   {"\n"}

            Applicable Privacy Laws and will make every effort to respond as

            was disclosed to.{"\n"} In certain exceptional circumstances, we may
            not be able to provide access to certain personal information it
            holds about an individual. For security purposes, not all personal
            information is accessible and amendable by the Privacy Officer. If
            access or corrections cannot be provided, we will notify the
            individual making the request within 30 days, in writing, of the
            reasons for the refusal.{"\n"}   {"\n"}
